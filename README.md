# CS171 (Visualization) Final Project:
Asking the Burning Questions: 
Visualizing The West Coastâ€™s Devastating New Normal

## Team Members:
Katherine Deng, Anna Li, Christina Wang

## Project Overview
For each of the past few years, California has been devastated by its worst wildfire season in modern history. Millions of acres have been destroyed, thousands of residents have been forced to relocate, and numerous lives have been lost. These tragedies have also sparked a fierce national conversation on climate change, and intense fears about the inhabitability of a warmer world. We want to dive into these conversations through visualizations of these wildfires.
